<p>Generate animations from frame-sets with ease!</p>

<p>
  This tool is a helper function that makes it easy to generate animations of
  any length from a folder full of frames.
</p>

<pre>
image taco = generate_animation("images/taco")
</pre>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
  If you have ever constructed animated images by doing the following, you
  quickly realize how tedious it can be.
</p>
<pre>
image tacos:
    "images/tacos/frame1"
    pause 0.2
    "images/tacos/frame2"
    pause 0.2
    "images/tacos/frame3"
    pause 0.2
    "images/tacos/frame4"
    pause 0.2
    "images/tacos/frame5"
    pause 0.2
    "images/tacos/frame6"
    pause 0.2
    repeat
</pre>
<p>
  While this approach is fine if you have few frames, or few animations, if you
  have to construct an animation with many frames, of a lot of animations, this
  quickly becomes a pain.
</p>
<p>
  Instead, for situations where the pause duration between frames remains
  constant, we can replace the above tedium with a simple function call.
</p>
<pre>
image taco = generate_animation("images/taco", pause=0.2, looping=True)
</pre>

<h3>What about ...?</h3>
<h4>Animations with variable framerates?</h4>
<p>
  If your animation hangs on some frames for longer or shorter than others, this
  is not the solution for you.  This will set the pause duration on all frames
  to the value given (or the default of <code>30</code>fps).

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/Foxcapades/renpy-generated-animations/releases/latest">latest release</a></li>
  <li>Unzip it into your project directory (the directory above <code>game</code>)</li>
  <li>Create a new directory inside your <code>game</code> directory to hold your animation frames</li>
  <li>Ensure your frame images are named in such a way that they will be ordered correctly</li>
  <li>Create your generated animation!</li>
</ol>
